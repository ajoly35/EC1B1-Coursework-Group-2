Our Github page for the EC1B1 coursework on Germany. 

Instructions for running our code (copied in the .ipynb file):

To run this code on Google Colab/Jupyter, the user should have access to the following excel files:

- International_Financial_Statistics_Germany.xlsx (26 kb)
- International_Financial_Statistics_US.xlsx (18 kb)

These files are accessible and can be downloaded from this Github page (uploaded files).

For google colab:

- click the Files icon to open the 'Files explorer' pane
- click the upload icon and select the excel files above from the 'File upload' dialog window
- Once the upload is complete, the code should run.

For Jupyter:

- Replace the file path shown on the first line of code (/content/International_Financial_Statistics_Germany.xlsx) by the relative file path (International_Financial_Statistics_Germany.xlsx) or your computer's own file path.
- Do the same procedure for the US dataset (/content/International_Financial_Statistics_US.xlsx). The relative file path is (International_Financial_Statistics_US.xlsx)
- Run the code normally
